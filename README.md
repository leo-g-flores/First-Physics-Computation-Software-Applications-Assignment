* Answer 3 questions about a rigid pendulum

**The [_Markdown Tutorial_](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) gave me great insights into this new language!**  
## Questions 1-3  
1. If the frequency of the drive is much higher than the natural frequency $\omega$ = $\sqrt{g/L}$ then the rigid pendulum will experience a larger displacement angle compared to that of the natural frequency, whereas the case in which the frequency of the drive is much lower than the natural frequency then the displacement angle of the pendulum will be less than that observed of the natural frequency. Now, if the amplitude of the drive is much smaller than the size of the pendulum then the displacement angle of the pendulum will be relatively small.
2. If the pivot point drops abruplty after the pendulum is slightly displaced from equilibrium, then the displacement angle of the pendulum will increase.
3. If the pivot point moves down at the same time as the pendulum begins to fall from its unstable equilibrium angle, then I expect the motion of the pivot point to slightly counter the motion of the pendulum.
